# Course

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
My project is about why Ai will make a huge difference for the society and community in the whole world. With its contribution and guiding it will improve the technology in the world. But it has a price aswell as it can increase the unemployment rate even further and it will make a negative effect on the society for the workers etc.


## Background
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
The main problem that Ai will solve is making the techology and machines much better and more accurate because it has stored alot of information and will make a better improvement from the information. 
A another problem that Ai will solve is to make the society and community more digitalised and automatised. But a huge disadvantage is that this might increase the unployment rate in the world since machines and robots will likely replace the human workers. Since the robots and machines can be programmed to do stuff etc.


## How is it used?

This solution is needed all the time, since we are depended on the technology no matter what we do today. The people in the whole world is depending on how the technology will turn out in the future and AI will be one solution to make the world more automatised and digitaliced. 
Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?

The information I took up and wrote about is my own opinions on how I feel about Ai taking a huge part of the whole world. So basically it is what I have learned and my own thoughts about the Ai Situation.  

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges
Like I said before about the AI. AI will solve many things like making technology much better and accurate. But it might aswell increase the unemployment rate and that is not good for the society specially for the economic of the country/world. 

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? 
If more people study about Ai, then more people will have a better understanding about Ai and work together to find the best possible solution to fix the situation about AI and stuff around it aswell.
